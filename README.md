# Liver-patient-prediction
In this project, we will analyze patients' health records collected from the North East of Andhra Pradesh, India to predict liver disease in these patients. This dataset consists of 583 patient records with 11 attributes that describe their age, gender, and lab blood results. The variable we would like to predict is the probability of liver disease.this project aims to assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and treatment planning, ultimately improving patient outcomes and resource allocation.

Project Goals:

Data Acquisition and Preparation: Collected a comprehensive dataset comprising patient health records with features related to liver function, such as age, gender, bilirubin levels, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and other relevant biomarkers. Data preprocessing included handling missing values, normalizing data, and encoding categorical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed EDA to explore and visualize the data, identifying trends and correlations between features and the presence of liver disease. This step involved generating summary statistics, plotting feature distributions, and detecting any anomalies or outliers.

Feature Engineering: Developed and selected relevant features to enhance the model's predictive performance. This included creating new features from existing ones, transforming variables, and selecting the most impactful predictors based on EDA results.

Model Selection and Training: Tested various machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), to determine the best approach for classifying patients as either having liver disease or not. Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Hyperparameter Optimization: Fine-tuned the chosen model to improve its performance. Employed techniques like Grid Search or Random Search for hyperparameter optimization and validated the model using cross-validation to ensure robust performance.

Documentation and Reporting: Documented the project methodology, including data preparation, model selection process, and evaluation results. Provided a comprehensive report summarizing the findings, the modelâ€™s performance, and recommendations for future enhancements.
